                It is every business person’s dream to make it to an official business dinner, or to sit amongst the big
                shots
                as many people say. With some empathetic listening, persuasive conversation and some proper dinner
                etiquette,
                you are on your way to sealing the deal. Now the question you are faced with, how well do you understand
                business dinner etiquette? Like many of us, we have very little understanding until we are presented
                with
                the
                circumstance. Today however, I will be teaching you some fundamentals on business dinner etiquette. Here
                are
                some things to consider before, during and after your meeting.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="highlighter">Setting</span>
                <br>
                Selecting your location is very critical and can affect the outcome of your meeting. You first want to
                make
                sure
                to choose something your familiar with so that no surprises may arise. Choose a place that is not overly
                expensive but yet provides tranquility and cleanliness. Anything otherwise can create distractions or
                make
                it
                hard to focus on the primary objective or target. You want to ensure that your prospect has your full
                attention
                and that no external noise or visuals disturbances take their focus elsewhere. If you are unaware of
                your
                client’s food choices, it is best to choose a place that is not limited in culture variation. For this
                reason,
                avoid sushi places unless you know your client’s food desires. Overall, be mindful of different eating
                habits
                and food choices. In other words, make sure the place you choose has a selection that caters to
                vegetarians,
                vegans, flexitarian, pescatarian, etc. The best in deciding where to eat is to do some research and find
                out
                what your client’s eating choices are before choosing a place. At the top of the website toolbar under
                restaurants, you will see suggested links to restaurants here in town that would be good places to
                consider
                for
                business dinners.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="highlighter">Before The Event</span>
                <br>
                Prior to arriving to the meeting, ensure you eat something small to avoid feeling hunger and not
                allowing
                yourself to concentrate on your client. Although this is a dinner meeting, it is intended for open
                conversation
                and first impressions. As previously stated, you want to devote your attention on the client and not the
                food.
                Since you are the primary spokesperson, or the person in charge of arranging the meeting, be sure to
                make
                reservations to avoid awkward wait times in the lobby. In addition, arrive earlier than you client, this
                will
                demonstrate accountability and the ability to be punctual. Upon arriving, put your phone on silence and
                wait
                for
                you guests at your reserved table. Keep your phone at eyesight until they arrive, just in case they try
                to
                call
                for any reason. Do not put your phone on vibrate during the meeting as this too can cause a distraction
                or
                annoyance to the client. The last recommendation before attending the meeting is to determine what you
                will
                order to eat. Do not waste time in trying to read the menu there or allow yourself to be dumbfounded by
                the
                various choices. See Menu options for more details
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="highlighter">First Impressions</span>
                <br>
                First impressions are crucial because you do not get a second chance at a first encounter. Make sure to
                dress
                the part, introduce yourself with a firm handshake and greet them with genuine sincerity. Dressing the
                part
                can
                fluctuate depending on the level of business professionalism involved. For some examples, I have
                provided a
                link
                called business attire to help demonstrate the different types of appropriate clothing options. Once the
                meet
                and greet has been settled, ensure all personal belongings are hidden away out of hindsight. This will
                demonstrate cleanliness and avoid obstruction of view.
            </p>
            <p>

                <span class="highlighter">Menu Options</span>
                <br>
                As previously recommended, know what you want to eat before arriving to the meeting. When choosing what
                to
                eat,
                consider price and cleanliness. You want to avoid overly expensive meals, strong odors, and something
                that
                is
                not messy. Messy can be anything with too much sauce, finger foods, foods that stain, foods that stay in
                your
                teeth or anything that requires large bite sizes. When ordering, do not be complicated and try to choose
                foods
                like chicken or salads which have less add-ons to take off and do not have caution temperatures. Allow
                your
                guest to order first, this could also open up ideas for you as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="highlighter">Table Manners</span>
                <br>
                There are two major concepts to understand when dealing with table manners. The first thing to consider,
                is
                understanding the usage of each utensil, and secondly would be how to properly eat in front of others.
                Some
                of
                these things may seem standard but quite important to reiterate or establish for those who may still be
                questioning proper etiquette. Many restaurants use different types of utensils and it can be quite
                confusing.
                Figure 1 helps to demonstrate what each utensil is used for. In addition, a video in the toolbar has
                been
                provided for further explanation. The video provides both topics on proper table manners and the correct
                usage
                of each utensil or silverware. Some general advice would be, remember to eat at a slower pace than your
                use
                to,
                do not eat with your mouth full and do not take big bites.
            </p>

                <span class="highlighter">Closing The Meeting</span>
                <br>
                Since you are seeking the partnership of the client, make the move to pay. Even if you did not initiate
                the
                meeting, it is good practice and or manner to attempt to pay. Also thank your guest for attending and
                taking
                the
                time to talk business. Make sure to thank them by name and give them eye contact. It is also not a bad
                idea
                to
                thank them again through email. This will provide your contact information for any future business and a
                quick
                recap of your meeting.
